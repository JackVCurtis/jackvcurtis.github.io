This is an [early technical guide](https://www.thegnar.com/blog/creating-passkey-authentication-in-a-rails-7-application) to passwordless authentication with passkeys. While the example used is Ruby on Rails, since the core functionality is implemented by Bitwarden's passkey service the guide is useful across any web stack.
